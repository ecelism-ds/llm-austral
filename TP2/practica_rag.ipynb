      "　　\"Getting to all her classes!\" Diego said. \"I heard her talking to Professor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were going on about yesterday's lesson, but Carolina can't 've been there, because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures!

She multitasked by attending multiple classes at the same time, reading ahead, finishing all her homework timely, and finding creative ways to fit in studying during free periods.
