      "Villalba was standing outside his hut, one hand on the collar of his enormous black boarhound, Fang. There were several open wooden crates on the ground at his feet, and Fang was whimpering and straining at his collar, apparently keen to investigate the contents more closely. As they drew nearer, an odd rattling noise reached their ears, punctuated by what sounded like minor explosions.\n",

      "Roberto, Diego, and Carolina had always known that Villalba had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three- headed dog he'd christened \"Fluffy.\" And if, as a boy, Villalba had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Roberto was sure he'd have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He'd probably thought\n",

One look told them that Villalba had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to be having difficulty getting them into focus.\n",
      "　　\"'Spect it's a record,\" he said thickly, when he recognized them. \"Don' reckon they've ever had a teacher who lasted on'y a day before.\"\n",

Villalba would have liked nothing better than a pet dragon, as Roberto, Diego, and Carolina knew only too well - he had owned one for a brief period during their first year, a vicious Norwegian Ridgeback by the name of Norbert. Villalba simply loved monstrous creatures, the more lethal, the better.\n",

Perhaps Roberto Gonzales is unaware of the unpleasant truth about his large friend - but Alfonso Dominguez surely has a duty to ensure that Roberto Gonzales, along with his fellow students, is warned about the dangers of associating with part-giants.\n",
